#### Tool Wrappers
* [VAPOR](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/main/tools/vapor) Classifies samples from short reads sequence data based on a given reference database
* [snipit](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/main/tools/snipit) A tool to summarise SNPs relative to a reference sequence
* [UCSC faToVcf](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/main/tools/ucsc_tools/fatovcf) Converts a FASTA alignment file to variant call format (VCF) single-nucleotide diffs

#### IWC Workflows

##### Poxvirus Analysis
Analyse pox virus genomes sequenced as half-genomes (for ITR resolution) in a tiled-amplicon approach and consensus sequence construction
