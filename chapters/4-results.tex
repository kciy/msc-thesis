\chapter{Results and Workflow Evaluation}\label{chap:results}

real-world data provided by Belgian Sciensano laboratory to test the workflow.

\section{Poxvirus Illumina Workflow}
Samples by Sciensano by Elisabeth Mathijs

\acs{IWC} link, primer scheme.
tested with \ac{LSDV} data,
pipeline outputs on 20L70, 20L81

\subsection{LSDV Datasets 20L70 and 20L81}

\section{AIV Workflow}\label{sec:4-aiv} 
Samples by Sciensano s4+s8, Tunesian?

point out output for downstream analyses

\subsection{AIV Datasets U2012100-n21\_S8 and U2008751-n5\_S4}
Quality report, snipit plots, IQ-Tree for \ac{HA}/\ac{NA}, consensus reference, VAPOR scores

\section{FMDV Workflow}
Samples by Pirbright Institute by Dr. Graham Freimanis

\section{Complexity Analysis of the Workflows}
complexity of each tool \\
multiple inputs -> sequences of fewer complexity can be neglected \\
plots for many/few samples and long/short reads \\

for optimisation purposes.

how is server capacity allocated for a workflow run?
