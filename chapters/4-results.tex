\chapter{Results and Workflow Evaluation}\label{chap:results}
The Galaxy workflows are validated using real-world datasets from different laboratories. The analysis results for each workflow with complying test samples are described below.

\section{Poxvirus Illumina Workflow}

Samples by Sciensano by Elisabeth Mathijs

\ac{IWC} link, primer scheme.
tested with \ac{LSDV} data,
pipeline outputs on 20L70, 20L81

\subsection{LSDV Datasets 20L70 and 20L81}

\section{AIV Workflow}\label{sec:4-aiv}
\todoit

We illustrate the utility of the workflow on the Galaxy platform, we use real datasets

Reference database for each influenza gene segment, prepared the collection from public INSAFlu data. Consists of 56 sequences

within-subtype variation is not captured well by this ref. database (1 reference per subtype)

controlling influenza A/B species assignment: 50 informative references

Samples by Sciensano s4+s8

point out output for downstream analyses 

\subsection{AIV Datasets U2012100-n21\_S8 and U2008751-n5\_S4}
\todoit
Quality report, snipit plots, IQ-Tree for \ac{HA}/\ac{NA}, consensus reference, VAPOR scores

\section{FMDV Workflow}
