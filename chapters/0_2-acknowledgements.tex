I want to thank Prof. Dr. Rolf Backofen for the opportunity to write my thesis in the Galaxy team of the Bioinformatics Group at University of Freiburg. I felt very welcomed despite spending most of the work hours in home office. I thank Prof. Dr. med. Marcus Panning for his interest and being my second examiner.\\
I am very thankful for my supervisor Dr. Wolfgang Maier, who motivated me with his huge expertise to dig into the details of the topic and who was there to answer my questions at all times. It was a very positive experience to work with you.\\
I want to thank Björn Grüning for welcoming me in the Galaxy universe and answering my very specific questions.\\
Lastly, I would like to thank my friends, family and colleagues for supporting me in every way throughout my studies.
