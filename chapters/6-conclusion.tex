% Summary of the main points of discussion and conclude by highlighting the significance of the research and its contribution to the field

"good quality assemblies/mappings rely on proper preprocessing and filtering to reduce the number of misassembly events, ambiguous assemblies and of incorporation of sequencing errors into the final assembly"

By relying on raw read data rather than assembled genomes and allowing every result to be traced back to its raw data, it goes a step beyond current surveillance efforts.

We show that viral genome analyses can be performed with public scientific infrastructure that is ready to use and based on a community-approved effort in an open-source software.
Galaxy WFs can be exported, adapted and used in other systems such as CWL, Nextflow, Snakemake

-> transparent data analyses tool that is robust and transparent to ensure quality and efficiency, all to empower scientists and health professionals to biomedical research
