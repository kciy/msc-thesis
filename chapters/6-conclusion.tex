Summary of objectives, achievements and discussion

By relying on raw read data rather than assembled genomes and allowing every result to be traced back to its raw data, it goes a step beyond current surveillance efforts.

We show that viral genome analyses can be performed with public scientific infrastructure that is ready to use and based on a community-approved effort in an open-source software.
Galaxy wfs can be exported, adapted and used in other systems such as CWL, Nextflow, Snakemake

-> transparent data analyses tool that is robust and transparent to ensure quality and efficiency, all to empower scientists and health professionals to biomedical research
