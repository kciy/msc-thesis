% rephrase problems/questions
- despite mass vaccination and considerable information available about viruses, disease outbreaks cause major losses and threats to livestock industry worlwide
- sequence analysis of livestock viruses to identify source outbreaks, monitor antigenic changes within virus strains, continued surveillance, vaccine matching, vaccine quality control
- build capacities in diagnostics, epidemiology, economics to improve information on the nature of virus circulation in the country's and region's specific environment
- provide public, transparent infrastructure for valuable modern surveillance methods -> work with NGS for WGS -> WGS allows for comprehensive genetic information, complete view of the genetic makeup including genes, structural variations -> use information to identify disease-causing mutations, determine relationships between populations and samples
- demands for these workflows are: easy to use, fast, reliable, adaptable, rely on sars-cov-2 research
- ZODIAC as scope for development of 3 Galaxy workflows for poxviruses, AIV, FMDV with accompanying training resources to empower employees to meaningful interpretation and act based on sample-specific insights, ultimately early detection and protect public health/avoid economic losses

\section{Contribution to the Field}
% Summarise key findings: both the significant and non-significant results
- 3 workflows for livestock viruses of relevance, objective to construct whole genome by curative methods from NGS raw reads to consensus sequence, without required user knowledge that reuse concepts from sars-cov-2 workflows 
- poxvirus wf: new approach that requires sequencing in tiling amplicon manner, two pools, reference-based mapping, avoids assembly, reference sequence is ok to choose because mutation rate is low for poxviruses, consensus calling. challenge for poxviruses: two identical ITRs, solved by tiling amplicon approach. tested with LSDV samples, multisample workflow, analysis can be continued by subsequent analyses. WGS on lsdv isolates is essential to capture genetic variation all at once, in the past it was shown that outbreaks and vaccines are linked, careful monitoring required. workflow published on iwc/dockstore/workflowhub for versioning and distribution, additional training material that guides through the workflow step by step. both for beginners and experts to adapt and meaningful usage
- aiv wf: objective is to construct whole genome from NGS raw reads, challenge: find good reference sequence for mapping. new method for reference-based mapping that does not require the user to select a reference and imply knowledge about the virus strain in the isolate, or arbitrary selection; avoid de novo assembly, thus: hybrid reference that accounts for influenza gene-specific "best matching reference" on a high resolution level. use database of thousands of possible reference sequences and by vapor approach, select and stack reference for mapping. downstream components for consensus construction is similar to sars-cov-2 workflows and proves to be efficiently work for our two AIV test samples. for aiv, wgs is in high demand for threat of reassortment that causes adaption of the virus to mammals and spillover to humans, detection of mutation and study of key minor assets. with phylogenetic classification and lineage assignment gain insight on relations, geo/temporal clustering, tracing of single outbreaks and routes of transmission, virus origin. more detailed than "only" subtype identification, wgs in aiv surveillance is very crucial for worldwide monitoring. many other downstream options from the generated workflow outputs
- fmdv wf: whole genome construction for such small virus genome with high genetic variation within one serotype and even "sub-type" makes it even more difficult to select reference sequence for mapping, short genome therefore tradeoff to use de novo assembly on the raw reads to construct a sequence to blast on, user is asked to pick result - still does not require much knowledge because of accompanying guidelines to be followed, wf is capable of detecting contamination or co-infection in the isolate. use blast result to download reference sequence for mapping in second workflow, reuse sars-cov-2 for proven to work consensus sequence construction. new approach in galaxy with low cost and time requirements, still serving base-by-base information for the sequenced sample. again phylogeny and other analyses are possible depending on the user. wf tested with four samples of different serotypes, consensus sequence was constructed and depends on number of raw reads for coverage, co-infection was detected, virus specific regions of polyc/polya tracts and termini are ambiguous and always pose challenge in assembly, still valuable insight to whole genome.

- summary: three new wgs workflows on galaxy, ready-to-use, embedded with additional resources, adaptable and transparent, allow for studying samples on base level, provide essential information for surveillance measures that are needed for modern virus containment
- highlight reference-based mapping vs. assembly
- contribute by open source concept on galaxy that is already known worldwide in bioinformatics, integrate into routine surveillance
